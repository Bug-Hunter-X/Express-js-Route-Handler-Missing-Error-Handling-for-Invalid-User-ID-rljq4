# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of error handling for invalid input. Specifically, the example shows a route that fetches a user by ID.  If the ID is not a valid number, the code will throw an error. This improved version includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully handle invalid IDs and other potential issues, improving application stability and user experience.

## Bug
The original code attempts to parse the user ID as an integer without any checks to see if it is a valid number.  This will result in a runtime error if a non-numeric ID is provided.
